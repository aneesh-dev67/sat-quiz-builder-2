    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "If 3x + 7 = 22, what is the value of x?",
      "choices": {
        "A": "3",
        "B": "5",
        "C": "7",
        "D": "15"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "To solve for x, subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 15. Then divide both sides by 3: x = 5."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "What is 20% of 150?",
      "choices": {

        "C": "30",
        "D": "35"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "To find 20% of 150, multiply 150 by 0.20: 150 × 0.20 = 30."

    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "A rectangle has a length of 12 cm and a width of 5 cm. What is its perimeter?",
      "choices": {
        "A": "17 cm",
        "B": "24 cm",
        "C": "34 cm",
        "D": "60 cm"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The perimeter of a rectangle is 2(length + width). So: 2(12 + 5) = 2(17) = 34 cm."
