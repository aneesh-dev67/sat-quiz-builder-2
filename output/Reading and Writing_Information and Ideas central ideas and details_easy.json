      "question": "Assessment Test Domain Skill Difficulty SAT Reading and Writing Information and Central Ideas and Ideas Details The following text is adapted from Sylvia Acevedo’s 2018 memoir Path to the Stars: My Journey from Girl Scout to Rocket Scientist. The narrator is traveling by car with her family to Mexico City. Mario and Laura are her brother and sister. Mario and I played games to see how many different license plates we could spot, and Laura liked to look for children in the back seats of the cars we passed. We were used to the forty-five-minute drive to El Paso and familiar with the six-hour ride to Chihuahua, but I wondered what the long journey to Mexico City would be like. ©2018 by Sylvia Acevedo According to the text, what did the narrator and Mario do while riding in the car?",
      "choices": {
        "A": "They read books.",
        "B": "They sang songs.",
        "C": "They went to sleep.",
        "D": "They played games."
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes what the narrator and Mario did while riding in the car. The text describes a car trip that the narrator is taking with her family. The text states that during the car ride, the narrator and Mario \"played games\" to see how many different license plates they could spot. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t mention the narrator and Mario reading during the car ride and instead describes them playing games. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t mention the narrator and Mario singing songs during the car ride and instead describes them playing games. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t mention the narrator and Mario sleeping during the car ride and instead describes them playing games."

      "question": "Assessment Test Domain Skill Difficulty SAT Reading and Writing Information and Central Ideas and Ideas Details Arthropods—brine shrimp, hawk moths, and many other invertebrate animals—have a nervous system made up of a brain, nerve cord, and other nerves. Researchers have gained insights about this system in ancient arthropods from traces found in various fossils. For example, in a study of two fossils of the extinct arthropod species Mollisonia symmetrica, Javier Ortega-Hernández, James Weaver, and team observed clear signs of a nerve cord. They also saw possible indications of a synganglion, a brain-like mass of nerves. Researchers hope to identify more features of the nervous systems of prehistoric arthropods as additional fossils are found. Which choice best states the main idea of the text?",
      "choices": {
        "A": "There are several similarities between the brains of hawk moths and the brains of brine shrimp.",
        "B": "Fossil evidence can contribute to the understanding of the nervous system in ancient arthropods.",
        "C": "Newly discovered fossils suggest that ancient hawk moths and ancient brine shrimp had spines.",
        "D": "Researchers need to focus on finding more fossils of ancient arthropods."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The text states that researchers have used fossils to learn about the nervous systems of ancient arthropods. It then provides a specific example of researchers studying fossils of Mollisonia symmetrica and finding evidence of a nerve cord and possibly a synganglion (a brain-like mass of nerves). The text concludes by noting that researchers hope to discover more features of prehistoric arthropods’ nervous systems \"as additional fossils are found.\" Thus, the main idea of the text is that fossil evidence can contribute to the understanding of the nervous system in ancient arthropods. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t compare the brains of hawk moths and brine shrimp. These animals are merely mentioned as examples of arthropods in the opening sentence, and the text doesn’t go on to discuss any similarities between their brains. Choice C is incorrect because the text discusses nervous systems, not spines, in ancient arthropods, and it doesn’t specifically mention findings about ancient hawk moths or brine shrimp. Choice D is incorrect. While the text concludes by noting that researchers aim to discover additional characteristics of prehistoric arthropods’ nervous systems as more fossils are uncovered, this statement doesn’t suggest that researchers need to focus on finding more fossils. Rather, it simply indicates that researchers expect to learn more about this topic as additional fossils are discovered. Moreover, the statement is just a detail that supports the main idea; it’s not the main idea itself."

      "question": "Assessment Test Domain Skill Difficulty SAT Reading and Writing Information and Central Ideas and Ideas Details To make her art more widely available, graphic artist Elizabeth Catlett turned to linocuts. In linocut printing, an artist carves an image into a sheet of linoleum to create a stamp that is used to mass-produce prints. In the linocut series The Black Woman (1946–1947), Catlett depicts the everyday experiences of Black women alongside the achievements of well-known Black women. This pairing invites the viewer to draw connections among the women. The linocut process enabled Catlett’s work to reach a wide audience and supported her aim to unite Black women through her art. According to the text, what is significant about Catlett’s use of linocut printing?",
      "choices": {
        "A": "Linocut printing involved using materials that were readily available to Catlett.",
        "B": "Linocut printing helped Catlett use art to connect people, especially Black women.",
        "C": "Catlett became commercially successful once she started using linocut printing.",
        "D": "Catlett was one of the first Black artists to use linocut printing."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer. The last sentence states that the linocut process “supported her [Catlett’s] aim to unite Black women through her art.” Choice A is incorrect. The text briefly describes the linocut printing process but doesn’t discuss the availability of the materials used in the process. Choice C is incorrect. The text says that the linocut process “enabled Catlett’s work to reach a wide audience,” but that doesn’t mean that linocuts made her “commercially successful.” In other words, we don’t know how much money she made off her linocuts—we only know that more people were able to see her work. Choice D is incorrect. The text says that Catlett depicted Black women in her linocuts, but not that she was one of the first Black artists to use linocut printing."

      "question": "Assessment Test Domain Skill Difficulty SAT Reading and Writing Information and Central Ideas and Ideas Details Shimmering is a collective defense behavior that researchers have observed in giant honeybee colonies. When shimmering, different groups of bees flip their bodies up and down in what looks like waves. This defense is initiated when hornets hover near a colony, serving to deter the hornets from approaching the bees. Researchers hypothesize that this behavior is a specialized defense response to hornets, as it is not observed when other, larger predators approach the colony. Which choice best states the main idea of the text?",
      "choices": {
        "A": "Researchers are unsure how giant honeybees defend against predators larger than hornets.",
        "B": "Researchers think that shimmering in giant honeybees is a specific defense against hornets.",
        "C": "Hornets are known to be the main predator of giant honeybees.",
        "D": "Several different species of insects use shimmering to defend against hornets."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer. The text describes a study about how giant honeybees use shimmering to defend against hornets, but not other predators. The researchers conclude that shimmering could be a specialized defense response to hornets. Choice A is incorrect. The text says that giant honeybees don’t appear to use shimmering against other, larger predators. However, it never suggests that researchers don’t know which other defenses giant honeybees do use for those predators. Choice C is incorrect. The text says that hornets are one predator of giant honeybees, but it doesn’t say that hornets are the main predator of giant honeybees. This choice also fails to mention “shimmering,” which is a major focus of the text. Choice D is incorrect. The text only discusses the shimmering of giant honeybees—it doesn’t discuss other insects’ defense responses at all."

      "question": "Assessment Test Domain Skill Difficulty SAT Reading and Writing Information and Central Ideas and Ideas Details Bicycles were first mass-produced in the late nineteenth century throughout Europe and North America, allowing individuals remarkable freedom to travel longer distances quickly and comfortably. This freedom, coupled with the affordability of the vehicle, made the bicycle immensely popular. Individuals were able to live farther from their workplaces, easily visit neighboring towns, and participate in new leisure and sport activities. Bicycling quickly became a popular social endeavor, with enthusiasts forming local cycling clubs to enjoy these newfound activities with others. Which choice best states the main idea of the text?",
      "choices": {
        "A": "The widespread adoption of the bicycle in the late nineteenth century provided new opportunities for people.",
        "B": "The affordability of the bicycle in the late nineteenth century made it the preferred way to travel.",
        "C": "The popularity of the bicycle in the late nineteenth century gave rise to the first cycling clubs.",
        "D": "The mass production of the bicycle in the late nineteenth century made it safer for people to use."
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer. The text discusses how the mass production of bicycles in the late nineteenth century allowed people to travel longer distances, live farther from their workplaces, visit neighboring towns, and participate in new activities and social clubs. All of these are new opportunities that were provided by the widespread adoption of the bicycle. Choice B is incorrect. The text never says this. It does say that the bicycle was “affordable,” and that the “freedom to travel longer distances quickly and comfortably” made the bicycle “popular,” but it never says that the bicycle was more popular than any other way of traveling (like cars or trains or horses). Choice C is incorrect. This is a detail mentioned in the text, but not the main idea. Cycling clubs are only one of the new opportunities that arose from the popularity of the mass-produced bicycle. A “main idea” should capture more of the information in the text. Choice D is incorrect. The text never says this. It doesn’t mention the safety of the mass-produced bicycle at all."

      "question": "Assessment Test Domain Skill Difficulty SAT Reading and Writing Information and Central Ideas and Ideas Details The following text is from Beatrice Harraden’s 1894 novel Ships that Pass in the Night. In an old second-hand bookshop in London, an old man sat reading Gibbon’s History of Rome. He did not put down his book when the postman brought him a letter. He just glanced indifferently at the letter, and impatiently at the postman. Zerviah Holme did not like to be interrupted when he was reading Gibbon; and as he was always reading Gibbon, an interruption was always regarded by him as an insult. Based on the text, how did Zerviah Holme most likely feel when the letter was delivered?",
      "choices": {
        "A": "He felt relieved because he had been expecting an important letter.",
        "B": "He felt excited because the letter was from a good friend.",
        "C": "He felt sad because the postman did not stop to talk with him before leaving.",
        "D": "He felt annoyed because he was interrupted while reading his favorite author."
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a description of how Zerviah Holme felt that is directly supported by the text. The text states that Holme \"did not like to be interrupted\" while reading Gibbon and that he considered interruptions to be \"an insult.\" Furthermore, the text suggests that Gibbon is Holme’s favorite author because, as the text states, \"he was always reading Gibbon.\" Thus, Holme would have felt annoyed at having been interrupted when the letter was delivered. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that Holme is relieved to receive the letter. Instead, the text states that Holme \"just glanced indifferently at the letter,\" suggesting that the letter wasn’t important to him. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that Holme is excited to receive the letter. Instead, the text states that Holme didn’t put down his book to receive the letter and that he looked at the letter \"indifferently\" and at the postman \"impatiently.\" This suggests that Holme isn’t excited. Also, there is no mention that Holme knows who sent the letter. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t indicate that Holme is sad or that he wants to speak with the postman. Instead, the text describes Holme as looking \"impatiently at the postman,\" which suggests that he wants the postman to leave."

      "question": "Assessment Test Domain Skill Difficulty SAT Reading and Writing Information and Central Ideas and Ideas Details Scent is tightly interwoven with our daily lives, often evoking significant memories and important social events. This connection is of growing interest to archaeologists who hope to use it to better understand ancient rituals, trade, social hierarchies, and medicine. Although the speed at which odor molecules dissipate makes identifying ancient scents challenging, advancements in biomolecular technologies show promise in unlocking ancient aromas from preserved artifacts. Archaeological studies making use of these advancements may provide new insights into past societies. According to the text, what is one reason some archaeologists are interested in recovering scents from ancient artifacts?",
      "choices": {
        "A": "They are investigating whether people’s sense of smell has declined in recent centuries.",
        "B": "They believe the scents could illuminate important aspects of ancient life.",
        "C": "They think that ancient scents would be enjoyable to people today.",
        "D": "They hope to develop new medicines using ancient scent molecules."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer. The text states that archaeologists are interested in using scents to better understand \"ancient rituals, trade, social hierarchies, and medicine,\" all of which are important aspects of ancient life. Choice A is incorrect. The text doesn’t say anything about investigating if people’s sense of smell has declined in recent centuries. It says that scents fade over time—not that people have gotten worse at smelling scents. Choice C is incorrect. The text says that archaeologists are interested in using scents to better understand \"ancient rituals, trade, social hierarchies, and medicine,\" but it doesn’t say anything about ancient scents being enjoyable to people today. Choice D is incorrect. The text doesn’t say anything about developing new medicines. Rather, it says that archaeologists are interested in using scents to better understand \"ancient rituals, trade, social hierarchies, and medicine.\""

      "question": "Assessment Test Domain Skill Difficulty SAT Reading and Writing Information and Central Ideas and Ideas Details The following text is from Shyam Selvadurai’s 1994 novel Funny Boy. The seven-year-old narrator lives with his family in Sri Lanka. Radha Aunty is the narrator’s aunt. Radha Aunty, who was the youngest in my father’s family, had left for America four years ago when I was three, and I could not remember what she looked like. I went into the corridor to look at the family photographs that were hung there. But all the pictures were old ones, taken when Radha Aunty was a baby or young girl. Try as I might, I couldn’t get an idea of what she looked like now. My imagination, however, was quick to fill in this void. ©1994 by Shyam Selvadurai. According to the text, why does the narrator consult some family photographs?",
      "choices": {
        "A": "He wants to use the photographs as inspiration for a story he is writing.",
        "B": "He is curious about how his father dressed a long time ago.",
        "C": "He hopes the photographs will help him recall what his aunt looked like.",
        "D": "He wants to remind his aunt of an event that is shown in an old photograph."

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer. The text states that the narrator couldn’t remember what his Radha Aunty looked like, so he went to look at the family photographs she was in. Choice A is incorrect. There’s no mention of any story that the narrator is writing. Rather, we’re told that the narrator couldn’t remember what his aunt looked like, so he went to look at the family photographs she was in. Choice B is incorrect. The text doesn’t mention how the narrator’s father dressed. Rather, we’re told that the narrator couldn’t remember what his aunt looked like, so he went to look at the family photographs she was in. Choice D is incorrect. The text doesn’t mention any events shown in the photographs.

      "question": "Assessment Test Domain Skill Difficulty SAT Reading and Writing Information and Central Ideas and Ideas Details Artist Justin Favela explained that he wanted to reclaim the importance of the piñata as a symbol in Latinx culture. To do so, he created numerous sculptures from strips of tissue paper, which is similar to the material used to create piñatas. In 2017, Favela created an impressive life-size piñata-like sculpture of the Gypsy Rose lowrider car, which was displayed at the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles, California. The Gypsy Rose lowrider was famously driven by Jesse Valadez, an early president of the Los Angeles Imperials Car Club. According to the text, which piece of Favela’s art was on display in the Petersen Automotive Museum in 2017?",
      "choices": {
        "A": "A painting of Los Angeles",
        "B": "A sculpture of a lowrider car",
        "C": "A painting of a piñata",
        "D": "A sculpture of Jesse Valadez"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer. The text describes Favela’s approach to sculpture, and then describes the lowrider car that he depicted in 2017. Choice A is incorrect. This isn’t what the text says. The Petersen Automotive Museum is located in Los Angeles, but Favela’s artwork isn’t a painting, and it doesn’t depict L.A. Choice C is incorrect. This isn’t what the text says. Favela makes sculptures similar to piñatas, not paintings of them. Choice D is incorrect. This isn’t what the text says. Jesse Valadez owned the lowrider car that Favela depicted in sculpture."

      "question": "Assessment Test Domain Skill Difficulty SAT Reading and Writing Information and Central Ideas and Ideas Details Archaeologist Veronica Waweru visited the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy in Kenya. While exploring there, Waweru noticed many rows of shallow pits carved into stone. Waweru believed the pits could have been used as game boards to play ancient versions of mancala, a two-person strategy game that is still popular today. Some of the more recent pits were carved on top of older pits. This led Waweru to think that the game was played at the site for a long time. According to the text, why does Waweru think that mancala was played at the site for a long time?",
      "choices": {
        "A": "Some of the newer pits were carved on top of the older pits.",
        "B": "She noticed many rows of shallow pits carved into stone.",
        "C": "She discovered the pits at the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy.",
        "D": "Some of the pits were shallow and others were quite deep."
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it presents a statement about Veronica Waweru’s thinking that is supported by the text. The text begins by discussing Waweru’s discovery of evidence that ancient versions of the board game mancala had been played at a site in the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy. The evidence consisted of many rows of shallow pits carved into stone. The text goes on to state that some newer pits were carved on top of older pits, suggesting that people may have continued to play the game there over multiple generations, creating new pits over time. The text then explicitly states that the presence of newer pits carved on top of older pits was precisely what caused Waweru to think that mancala had been played at the site for a long time. Choice B is incorrect. While the text does state that Waweru \"noticed many rows of shallow pits carved into stone,\" this observation led her to believe that the pits could have been used as game boards for ancient versions of mancala but did not specifically suggest to her that the game had been played at the site for a long time. The multiple rows of pits merely suggest that these pits functioned as part of a game board; they don’t necessarily indicate how long the site had been used for that purpose. Rather, it was the fact that there appeared to be newer pits carved on top of older pits that led Waweru to think that mancala had been played at the site for a long time. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text states that Waweru found the pits at the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, this isn’t the reason the text gives for why she thought that mancala had been played at the site for a long time. The location of the discovery only provides information about where the game was played, not how long the game had been played there. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t mention any variation in the depth of the pits. The text only describes the pits collectively as shallow and doesn’t indicate that the depth of the pits factored into Waweru’s thinking about how long the site had been used for playing mancala."

      "question": "Assessment Test Domain Skill Difficulty SAT Reading and Writing Information and Central Ideas and Ideas Details The following text is adapted from Johanna Spyri’s 1881 novel Heidi (translated by Elisabeth Stork in 1915). Eight-year-old Heidi and her friend’s grandmother are looking at some illustrated books. Heidi had come and was looking with wondering eyes at the splendid pictures in the large books, that Grandmama was showing her. Suddenly she screamed aloud, for there on the picture she saw a peaceful flock grazing on a green pasture. In the middle a shepherd was standing, leaning on his crook. The setting sun was shedding a golden light over everything. With glowing eyes Heidi devoured the scene. Which choice best states the main idea of the text?",
      "choices": {
        "A": "Heidi is upset until she sees a serene image of a pasture in one of Grandmama’s books.",
        "B": "Heidi is delighted and fascinated by an image she sees in one of Grandmama’s books.",
        "C": "Heidi is initially frightened by an image in one of Grandmama’s books but quickly comes to appreciate its beauty.",
        "D": "Heidi is inspecting an image in one of Grandmama’s books because she has never seen a shepherd with his sheep before."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most effectively states the main idea of the text, which is that Heidi is delighted and fascinated by an image she sees in one of Grandmama’s books. In the text, Heidi screams upon first seeing the picture of the green pasture. In another context, such a reaction might suggest fear, but here the reaction is followed by descriptions of an image that’s peaceful rather than scary. The text goes on to describe Heidi’s eyes as “glowing” and states that she “devoured the scene,” suggesting that the image delights and fascinates her so much that she wants to examine every detail. Together, these descriptions suggest that Heidi is thrilled and intrigued by the image in the book. Choice A is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that Heidi is upset before seeing the peaceful image of the green pasture. Before Heidi sees that image, the text describes her as “looking with wondering eyes at the splendid pictures” in the book, suggesting that Heidi is intrigued, not that she’s unhappy. Choice C is incorrect. Although Heidi screams upon first seeing the image, the text’s description of the image and Heidi’s other reactions to it suggest that she is screaming with delight, not fear. The text describes the images in the book as “splendid” and the particular image that causes her to scream as peaceful rather than frightening. It also describes Heidi’s eyes as “glowing” and states that she “devoured the scene,” suggesting that the image of the green pasture delights and fascinates her so much that she wants to examine every detail. Choice D is incorrect because it’s unclear from the text whether Heidi has ever seen a shepherd with his sheep before. The text merely suggests that she is delighted and fascinated by the image of the shepherd and his sheep."

      "question": "Assessment Test Domain Skill Difficulty SAT Reading and Writing Information and Central Ideas and Ideas Details In the 1960s, Chavela Vargas became an unlikely star in ranchera, a style of traditional Mexican music. Most ranchera singers had clear, polished voices and performed with a full band. But Vargas accompanied her raspy voice with just her guitar. Dressed in men’s trousers and a poncho, she would perform classic songs that had been written from a male point of view and were usually sung by men. She also altered those songs by performing them much more slowly than other ranchera singers did. The slower tempo allowed her to express the emotional quality of the lyrics more fully. According to the text, what is one way that Vargas differed from other ranchera singers?",
      "choices": {
        "A": "She possessed a voice that was clear and polished.",
        "B": "She avoided singing songs written from a male point of view.",
        "C": "She disliked performing classic songs.",
        "D": "She altered classic songs by slowing them down."
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it accurately describes an aspect of Chavela Vargas that the text indicates is unusual among ranchera artists. According to the text, Vargas differed from other ranchera singers by slowing the tempo of classic songs, which allowed her to express the emotional quality of the lyrics more fully. Choice A is incorrect because the text states that Vargas possessed an unusually raspy voice for a ranchera singer, not a clear and polished voice. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that Vargas was known to perform songs written from a male point of view, not that she avoided such songs. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Vargas disliked performing classic songs. Rather, it suggests that she found innovative ways of performing them to emphasize their emotional content, which seems to suggest an affinity for such songs, not dislike."

      "question": "Assessment Test Domain Skill Difficulty SAT Reading and Writing Information and Central Ideas and Ideas Details Microplastics are pieces of plastic that are smaller than a grain of rice. These small plastics can be found in large quantities in ocean waters. Ecologist Jessica Reichert and her team are studying the role reef-building corals have in capturing microplastics from ocean waters. Through research, her team has found that these corals may be storing up to 20 million kilograms of microplastics each year in their skeletons and tissues.

        "D": "Ecologists predict that corals store large amounts of microplastics from ocean waters."
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer. The text describes a study about how reef-building corals capture microplastics from ocean waters, which found that these corals are storing 20 million kilograms of microplastics in their skeletons and tissues. Choice A is incorrect. While the researchers are studying “reef-building corals,” the focus of their study isn’t how the corals build the reefs. Rather, they’re studying how corals may be storing microplastics from ocean waters. Choice B is incorrect. The text doesn’t mention any unanswered questions about the impact of corals on ocean ecosystems—rather, the study assesses one interaction between corals and microplastics. Choice C is incorrect. The text does say this, but it’s a detail—not the main idea.

        "D": "201 million years old"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it gives the age for the fossil discovered by Wang and colleagues that is directly supported by the text. According to the text, Xin Wang and colleagues discovered a 164-million-year-old plant fossil. This plant fossil included a flower bud, which the researchers believe provides evidence that flowering plants emerged in the Jurassic period, which falls between 145 million and 201 million years ago. Choice A is incorrect because the text states that Wang and colleagues discovered a 164-million-year-old flowering plant fossil in China, not one that is 150 million years old. Although 150 million years ago would fall within the Jurassic period, according to the text it isn’t the age of the discovered fossil. Choice B is incorrect because the text states that Wang and colleagues discovered a 164-million-year-old flowering plant fossil in China, not one that is 145 million years old. Although 145 million years ago would fall at the end of the Jurassic period, according to the text it isn’t the age of the discovered fossil. Choice D is incorrect because the text states that Wang and colleagues discovered a 164-million-year-old flowering plant fossil in China, not one that is 201 million years old.

      "question": "Assessment Test Domain Skill Difficulty SAT Reading and Writing Information and Central Ideas and Ideas Details NASA’s Cassini probe has detected an unusual wobble in the rotation of Mimas, Saturn’s smallest moon. Using a computer model to study Mimas’s gravitational interactions with Saturn and tidal forces, geophysicist Alyssa Rhoden and colleagues have proposed that this wobble could be due to a liquid ocean moving beneath the moon’s icy surface. The researchers believe other moons should be examined to see if they too might have oceans hidden beneath their surfaces. Which choice best states the main idea of the text?",
      "choices": {
        "A": "Rhoden and colleagues were the first to confirm that several of Saturn’s moons contain hidden oceans.",
        "B": "Research has failed to identify signs that there is an ocean hidden beneath the surface of Mimas.",
        "C": "Rhoden and colleagues created a new computer model that identifies moons with hidden oceans without needing to analyze the moons’ rotation.",
        "D": "Research has revealed that an oddity in the rotation of Mimas could be explained by an ocean hidden beneath its surface."
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer. The study isn’t definitive, but it says that Mimas’s wobbly rotation could be explained by the hidden ocean. Choice A is incorrect. This choice goes too far beyond the information in the text. Rhoden’s team proposed that one moon of Saturn could have a liquid ocean beneath its surface, and that other moons should also be examined, but no one has confirmed anything. Choice B is incorrect. This choice conflicts with the text. Research has identified at least one sign—the unusual wobble in Mimas’s rotation—that might be due to a hidden ocean beneath its surface. Choice C is incorrect. This choice doesn’t reflect the text. The computer model studies “gravitational interactions,” which seem to account for the wobbly rotation of Mimas."

      "question": "Assessment Test Domain Skill Difficulty SAT Reading and Writing Information and Central Ideas and Ideas Details In 2022, researchers rediscovered ancient indigenous glyphs, or drawings, on the walls of a cave in Alabama. The cave’s ceiling was only a few feet high, affording no position from which the glyphs, being as wide as ten feet, could be viewed or photographed in their entirety. However, the researchers used a technique called photogrammetry to assemble numerous photos of the walls into a 3D model. They then worked with representatives of tribes originally from the region, including the Chickasaw Nation, to understand the significance of the animal and humanoid figures adorning the cave. According to the text, what challenge did the researchers have to overcome to examine the glyphs?",
      "choices": {
        "A": "The cave was so remote that the researchers couldn’t easily reach it.",
        "B": "Some of the glyphs were so faint that they couldn’t be photographed.",
        "C": "The researchers were unable to create a 3D model of the cave.",

      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer. The text describes the very low ceiling of the cave, making it impossible to photograph the very wide glyphs all at once. Choice A is incorrect. The text doesn’t say this. It never suggests that the cave was remote or difficult to access, just that the cave itself was difficult to photograph well. Choice B is incorrect. The text doesn’t say this. The glyphs were so wide that they couldn’t be photographed completely. Choice C is incorrect. The text states the opposite of this. The researchers “used a technique called photogrammetry to assemble numerous photos of the walls into a 3D model.”"

The tree produces a milky substance called latex that is used to make rubber. The bark of Hevea brasiliensis is helpful for the process of making rubber because it has a unique structure that makes it easy to collect latex. A network of tubes in the tree’s inner bark helps the latex to flow out easily when people make small cuts into the bark. What feature of Hevea brasiliensis does the text say is helpful for the process of making rubber?",
      "choices": {
        "A": "Its latex produces rubber of an especially high quality.",
        "B": "Its bark has a unique structure that makes it easy to collect latex.",
        "C": "It is able to grow in a wide variety of climates around the world.",
        "D": "It is one of only two trees in the Amazon that produce latex."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately states what feature of Hevea brasiliensis is helpful for the process of making rubber. According to the text, this tree species produces latex, which is used to make rubber, and its inner bark contains a \"network of tubes\" that, when cut, enables the latex to flow out. The text explicitly states that this feature of Hevea brasiliensis is \"helpful for the process of making rubber.\" Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t mention the quality of the rubber produced from the latex of Hevea brasiliensis or compare its quality to that of rubber produced from other sources. Choice C is incorrect because the text never discusses the climates in which Hevea brasiliensis grows. Moreover, the text mentions only one region where this tree is found: the Amazon rainforest. Choice D is incorrect. Because the text states that Hevea brasiliensis is the world’s \"main source of natural rubber,\" it can be inferred that there is at least one other source. However, the text doesn’t specify whether that other source is also a tree species and, if so, whether that species grows in the Amazon rainforest."

      "question": "Assessment Test Domain Skill Difficulty SAT Reading and Writing Information and Central Ideas and Ideas Details When fashion designer Lloyd Henri Kiva New opened his store in Scottsdale, Arizona, in 1945, he quickly became known for creating delicately crafted leather goods, like belts and hats. He was perhaps most renowned for his colorful handbags, which he made by hand using a long and painstaking process. As he gained more customers, New began using sewing machines and other tools to help him produce bags more efficiently, though he continued to handcraft the crucial details that made each bag unique. Based on the text, what would have been the most likely consequence if New had not begun using sewing machines?",
      "choices": {
        "A": "He would have been unable to ensure that each bag included unique, handcrafted details.",
        "B": "He would have struggled to meet the increasing demand for his bags.",
        "C": "He would have had to individually design each bag he produced.",
        "D": "He would not have been able to generate as much interest in his bags."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it presents the most likely consequence if New had not begun using sewing machines. The text states that New gained new customers and that sewing machines allowed him to make bags more efficiently, or in less time than he could when sewing by hand. It’s reasonable to conclude that if New hadn’t reduced the time it took to make each bag by starting to use sewing machines, it would have been hard for him to keep up with the increased demand. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that New added unique, handcrafted details to his bags before he started using sewing machines and continued to do so after he started using them. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that individually designing each bag would have been a consequence of not using sewing machines, since New was already designing unique details for each bag before he started using sewing machines and continued to do so after he started using them. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that people were already interested in New’s bags before he started using sewing machines. Rather than allowing New to generate more interest in his bags, sewing machines helped New keep up with the interest that had already grown."

Choice B is incorrect because the text never indicates that Gloria Richardson led her daughter Donna’s high school.

      "question": "Assessment Test Domain Skill Difficulty SAT Reading and Writing Information and Central Ideas and Ideas Details In 2014, Amelia Quon and her team at NASA set out to build a helicopter capable of flying on Mars. Because Mars’s atmosphere is only one percent as dense as Earth’s, the air of Mars would not provide enough resistance to the rotating blades of a standard helicopter for the aircraft to stay aloft. For five years, Quon’s team tested designs in a lab that mimicked Mars’s atmospheric conditions. The craft the team ultimately designed can fly on Mars because its blades are longer and rotate faster than those of a helicopter of the same size built for Earth. According to the text, why would a helicopter built for Earth be unable to fly on Mars?",
      "choices": {
        "A": "Because Mars and Earth have different atmospheric conditions",
        "B": "Because the blades of helicopters built for Earth are too large to work on Mars",
        "C": "Because the gravity of Mars is much weaker than the gravity of Earth",
        "D": "Because helicopters built for Earth are too small to handle the conditions on Mars"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it presents an explanation about a helicopter that is directly supported by the text. The text states that Mars’s atmosphere is much less dense than Earth’s, and as a result, the air on Mars doesn’t provide the resistance required to support the blades of a helicopter built for Earth and to keep the helicopter aloft. In other words, a helicopter built for Earth can’t fly on Mars because of the differences in the two planets’ atmospheres. Choice B is incorrect because instead of stating that the blades of helicopters built for Earth are too large to work on Mars, the text indicates that the helicopter built to fly on Mars actually has even longer blades than a helicopter built for Earth. Choice C is incorrect because the text never addresses the role of gravity on Mars or on Earth; instead, it focuses on atmospheric conditions. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t indicate that helicopters built for Earth are too small to operate in the conditions on Mars. In fact, the text states that the size of the helicopter built to fly on Mars is the same size as a helicopter built for Earth, even though it has longer blades that rotate faster."

      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately states how the narrator feels about being at summer camp. In the text, the narrator states that after arriving at the camp, he found it to be different than he’d expected and that as a result, he felt \"scared, but also excited.\" Choice A is incorrect. In the text, the narrator describes himself as \"excited.\" Although excitement is a positive emotion, it isn’t as intensely positive as feeling overjoyed is. Moreover, the narrator also notes that he felt \"scared.\" In other words, his excitement (a positive emotion) is balanced with fear (a negative emotion). Given this mixture of positive and negative emotions, it would be inaccurate to characterize the narrator as overjoyed. Choice B is incorrect because in the text, the narrator describes himself as having felt both fear and excitement. Neither of these emotions can be thought of as peaceful and, in fact, are almost the opposite of a sense of peace. Choice D is incorrect because in the text, the narrator describes himself as both \"scared\" and \"excited,\" not angry and jealous."

The narrator notes that Lutie thinks the street looks nice in the light of the sunset. The narrator goes on to describe what Lutie can see in the street: children playing ball or tag and girls skipping rope. Thus, what is happening in the text is that Lutie is observing the appearance of the street at a particular time of day and the events occurring on it. Choice B is incorrect.

However, it never says that other women were inspired by Alspaugh. Choice B is incorrect. This is too general and too strong. The text says that Alspaugh’s scrapbook is a historical record of nineteenth-century textiles and dressmaking, but it never says that historians rely on such scrapbooks in general to understand how fashions changed throughout that time period. This choice also fails to even mention Alspaugh, who is the real focus of the text. Choice C is incorrect. The text does say this, but it’s a detail—not the main idea.

According to the text, as the narrator walks across the stage to her piano, she recalls her teacher’s advice to pretend that she is playing for only one person. The text indicates that this advice was intended to help manage any nerves related to performing.

      "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The text begins by stating that Flanagan was chosen in 1935 to lead the Federal Theatre Project (FTP), which was part of a program created by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The text then explains that as the director of the FTP, Flanagan created jobs for more than 12,500 theater professionals and ensured that ticket prices stayed low so that many people could afford to experience theater for the first time. Thus, the main idea of the text is that as the FTP’s director, Flanagan succeeded in creating many jobs and introducing people to theater. Choice A is incorrect. The text does suggest that jobs provided by the FTP were intended mainly for theater professionals, but this isn’t the text’s main idea. The focus of the text is Hallie Flanagan’s work as the director of the FTP, with the text’s main point being that Flanagan succeeded in creating many jobs and introducing people to theater. Choice B is incorrect. The text does state that President Roosevelt created the WPA to provide jobs for unemployed people, but this is supporting information, not the text’s main idea. The focus of the text is Hallie Flanagan’s work as the director of the FTP, which was part of the WPA, and the text’s main point is that Flanagan succeeded in creating many jobs and introducing people to theater. Choice C is incorrect. It’s true that many people couldn’t afford to buy theater tickets during the Great Depression, but this isn’t the text’s main idea. The focus of the text is Hallie Flanagan’s work as the director of the FTP, with the text’s main point being that Flanagan succeeded in creating many jobs and introducing people to theater."

      "question": "Assessment Test Domain Skill Difficulty SAT Reading and Writing Information and Central Ideas and Ideas Details The following text is from Edith Nesbit’s 1902 novel Five Children and It. Five young siblings have just moved with their parents from London to a house in the countryside that they call the White House. It was not really a pretty house at all; it was quite ordinary, and mother thought it was rather inconvenient, and was quite annoyed at there being no shelves, to speak of, and hardly a cupboard in the place. Father used to say that the ironwork on the roof and coping was like an architect’s nightmare. But the house was deep in the country, with no other house in sight, and the children had been in London for two years, without so much as once going to the seaside even for a day by an excursion train, and so the White House seemed to them a sort of Fairy Palace set down in an Earthly Paradise. Which choice best states the main idea of the text?",
      "choices": {
        "A": "Although their parents believe the house has several drawbacks, the children are enchanted by it.",
        "B": "The children don’t like the house nearly as much as their parents do.",
        "C": "Each member of the family admires a different characteristic of the house.",
        "D": "The house is beautiful and well built, but the children miss their old home in London."
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer. The text lists complaints about the house made by the mother and father, but then it says that the children thought the house was a \"Fairy Palace\" and \"Earthly Paradise.\" Choice B is incorrect. The text states the opposite of this. It describes how the mother and father dislike the house and says the children think the house seems like paradise. Choice C is incorrect. This isn’t what the text says. Only the children are said to admire the house; mother and father both complain about the house. Choice D is incorrect. The text states the opposite of this. It tells us the house was ugly and poorly built (\"an architect’s nightmare\") and suggests the children were tired of London."

      "question": "Assessment Test Domain Skill Difficulty SAT Reading and Writing Information and Central Ideas and Ideas Details In the 1700s and 1800s, European composers experimented with volume in their musical works. They did so by increasing the number of musicians playing in the orchestra. For example, in some of his operas, German composer Richard Wagner added more horns, trombones, and tubas to the orchestra. With more instruments playing at the same time, the orchestra could play extremely loudly at key moments in his operas. According to the text, how did Richard Wagner achieve moments of extremely high volume in his operas?",
      "choices": {
        "A": "By moving the performances of his operas from outdoor stages to indoor ones",
        "B": "By increasing the number of musicians playing horns, trombones, and tubas in the orchestra",
        "C": "By building a concert hall whose shape would cause sounds to echo",
        "D": "By insisting that the singers undergo special training to sing for extended periods of time"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it presents a statement about how Richard Wagner achieved moments of extremely high volume in his operas that is supported by the text. The text states that European composers experimented with volume in their works by increasing the number of musicians in the orchestra and provides the example of Wagner, who \"added more horns, trombones, and tubas to the orchestra.\" The text explains that by having more of these instruments playing at the same time, the overall volume of the orchestra could be dramatically increased at key moments in Wagner’s operas. Choice A is incorrect because the text never indicates that Wagner moved his operas indoors to achieve moments of extremely high volume, nor does it indicate that his operas were previously performed outdoors. The only technique discussed in the text for achieving extremely high volume is Wagner’s addition of more instruments to create a bigger, louder orchestra. Choice C is incorrect because the text never says that Wagner built or used a specially designed concert hall to increase volume through echoes. The only technique discussed in the text is Wagner’s addition of more instruments to create a bigger, louder orchestra. Choice D is incorrect because the text never mentions any special training for singers related to volume or singing for extended periods. The text’s focus is entirely on the orchestra and how Wagner and other European composers used instruments to experiment with volume in their musical works."

      "question": "Assessment Test Domain Skill Difficulty SAT Reading and Writing Information and Central Ideas and Ideas Details Psychologists wanted to test how young children think about rewards and fairness. In an experiment, two teachers handed out rewards while children (ages four to six) watched. The teachers gave out the same number of rewards, but one of them counted the rewards out loud. The children were then asked who was fairer. 73% chose the teacher who counted. The psychologists think that counting showed the children that the teacher wanted to be fair. The children may have believed that the teacher who did not count did not care about fairness. Which choice best states the main idea of the text?",
      "choices": {
        "A": "Psychologists think children cannot understand the concept of fairness until they are six years old.",
        "B": "An experiment found that counting out loud is the best way to teach mathematical concepts to children.",
        "C": "Psychologists think young children expect to be rewarded when the children show that they care about fairness.",
        "D": "An experiment showed that the way rewards are given out may affect whether young children think the situation is fair."
      },
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer. The text describes a study assessing how children think of rewards and fairness and its results. It concludes that the children in the study may have thought that a teacher who counted out loud when giving rewards cared more about fairness than a teacher who did not count out loud. Choice A is incorrect. The children in the study are described as being “four to six,” and the text doesn’t mention any differences among the different ages. Choice B is incorrect. The experiment wasn’t about teaching math—rather, it was about how counting out loud affected the children’s perception of fairness. Choice C is incorrect. The experiment doesn’t focus on whether the children care about fairness, and the text never mentions the children’s expectations of being rewarded."

      "question": "Assessment Test Domain Skill Difficulty SAT Reading and Writing Information and Central Ideas and Ideas Details The following text is adapted from Oscar Wilde’s 1891 novel The Picture of Dorian Gray. Dorian Gray is taking his first look at a portrait that Hallward has painted of him. Dorian passed listlessly in front of his picture and turned towards it. When he saw it he drew back, and his cheeks flushed for a moment with pleasure. A look of joy came into his eyes, as if he had recognized himself for the first time. He stood there motionless and in wonder, dimly conscious that Hallward was speaking to him, but not catching the meaning of his words. The sense of his own beauty came on him like a revelation. He had never felt it before. According to the text, what is true about Dorian?",
      "choices": {
        "A": "He wants to know Hallward’s opinion of the portrait.",
        "B": "He is delighted by what he sees in the portrait.",
        "C": "He prefers portraits to other types of paintings.",
        "D": "He is uncertain of Hallward’s talent as an artist."
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it presents a statement about Dorian that is directly supported by the text. The narrator of the text says that when Dorian sees his portrait, “his cheeks flushed for a moment with pleasure” and “a look of joy came into his eyes.” The narrator goes on to say that Dorian looked at the portrait “in wonder” and presents him as being so entranced by the portrait that he doesn’t notice what Hallward is saying to him. All these details support the description of Dorian as being delighted by what he sees in the portrait. Choice A is incorrect because Dorian isn’t depicted as interested in Hallward’s opinion of the portrait but rather as so enraptured by the painting that he’s hardly even aware of Hallward. Choice C is incorrect because the portrait of Dorian is the only painting that is mentioned in the text, so there’s no evidence that Dorian prefers portraits to other types of paintings. Although Dorian is depicted as delighted with this particular portrait, there’s no way of knowing from the text whether he likes portraits better than other kinds of paintings. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Dorian is uncertain about Hallward’s talent. Instead, the text is focused on Dorian’s delight with the portrait."
